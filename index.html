        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I am a freshmen at CSULB. I graduated from Cypress High School in 2020. I really love to play basketball and I've been playing the game ever since I was 7. I began getting into Computer Science in High School, but really never knew how to code up until my senior year when I took a Comp Sci class. I really started enjoying coding for the class because we would be making tons of games and apps and that seemed fun.

I have 2 older brothers, one of them is 21 yrs old and the other is 27 yrs old. The 21 yr old is about to enter his third year in CSULB and he is majoring in Sports Managment. The 27 yr old is an accountant.</p>
